    <p>What is computer networking?
      Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with
      each other. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit
      information over physical or wireless technologies.

      Let’s answer some common computer networking FAQs.

      How does a computer network work?
      Nodes and links are the basic building blocks in computer networking. A network node may be data communication
      equipment (DCE) such as a modem, hub or, switch, or data terminal equipment (DTE) such as two or more
      computers
      and printers. A link refers to the transmission media connecting two nodes. Links may be physical, like cable
      wires or optical fibers, or free space used by wireless networks.

      In a working computer network, nodes follow a set of rules or protocols that define how to send and receive
      electronic data via the links. The computer network architecture defines the design of these physical and
      logical
      components. It provides the specifications for the network’s physical components, functional organization,
      protocols, and procedures.

      What do computer networks do?
      Computer networks were first created in the late 1950s for use in the military and defense. They were
      initially
      used to transmit data over telephone lines and had limited commercial and scientific applications. With the
      advent
      of internet technologies, a computer network has become indispensable for enterprises.

      Modern-day network solutions deliver more than connectivity. They are critical for the digital transformation
      and
      success of businesses today. Underlying network capabilities have become more programmable, automated, and
      secure.

    <p>IP Address Definition And Explanation
      An Internet Protocol (IP) address is the unique identifying number assigned to every device connected to the
      internet. An IP address definition is a numeric label assigned to devices that use the internet to
      communicate.
      Computers that communicate over the internet or via local networks share information to a specific location
      using
      IP addresses.

      IP addresses have two distinct versions or standards. The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address is the
      older
      of the two, which has space for up to 4 billion IP addresses and is assigned to all computers. The more recent
      Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) has space for trillions of IP addresses, which accounts for the new breed
      of
      devices in addition to computers. There are also several types of IP addresses, including public, private,
      static,
      and dynamic IP addresses.

      Every device with an internet connection has an IP address, whether it's a computer, laptop, IoT device, or
      even
      toys. The IP addresses allow for the efficient transfer of data between two connected devices, allowing
      machines
      on different networks to talk to each other.

      How does an IP address work?
      An IP address works in helping your device, whatever you are accessing the internet on, to find whatever data
      or
      content is located to allow for retrieval.

      Common tasks for an IP address include both the identification of a host or a network, or identifying the
      location
      of a device. An IP address is not random. The creation of an IP address has the basis of math. The Internet
      Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates the IP address and its creation. The full range of IP addresses
      can go
      from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.

      With the mathematical assignment of an IP address, the unique identification to make a connection to a
      destination
      can be made.

      Public IP address
      A public IP address, or external-facing IP address, applies to the main device people use to connect their
      business or home internet network to their internet service provider (ISP). In most cases, this will be the
      router. All devices that connect to a router communicate with other IP addresses using the router’s IP
      address.

      Knowing an external-facing IP address is crucial for people to open ports used for online gaming, email and
      web
      servers, media streaming, and creating remote connections.

      Private IP address
      A private IP address, or internal-facing IP address, is assigned by an office or home intranet (or local area
      network) to devices, or by the internet service provider (ISP). The home/office router manages the private IP
      addresses to the devices that connect to it from within that local network. Network devices are thus mapped
      from
      their private IP addresses to public IP addresses by the router.

      Private IP addresses are reused across multiple networks, thus preserving valuable IPv4 address space and
      extending addressability beyond the simple limit of IPv4 addressing (4,294,967,296 or 2^32).

      In the IPv6 addressing scheme, every possible device has its own unique identifier assigned by the ISP or
      primary
      network organization, which has a unique prefix. Private addressing is possible in IPv6, and when it's used
      it's
      called Unique Local Addressing (ULA).

      Static IP address
      All public and private addresses are defined as static or dynamic. An IP address that a person manually
      configures
      and fixes to their device’s network is referred to as a static IP address. A static IP address cannot be
      changed
      automatically. An internet service provider may assign a static IP address to a user account. The same IP
      address
      will be assigned to that user for every session.

      Dynamic IP address
      A dynamic IP address is automatically assigned to a network when a router is set up. The Dynamic Host
      Configuration Protocol (DHCP) assigns the distribution of this dynamic set of IP addresses. The DHCP can be
      the
      router that provides IP addresses to networks across a home or an organization.

      Each time a user logs into the network, a fresh IP address is assigned from the pool of available (currently
      unassigned) IP addresses. A user may randomly cycle through several IP addresses across multiple sessions.

      What Is IPv4?
      IPv4 is the fourth version of the IP. It is one of the core protocols of the standards-based methods used to
      interconnect the internet and other networks. The protocol was first deployed on the Atlantic Packet Satellite
      Network (SATNET), which was a satellite network that formed a segment of the initial stages of the internet,
      in
      1982. It is still used to route most internet traffic despite the existence of IPv6.

      IPv4 is currently assigned to all computers. An IPv4 address uses 32-bit binary numbers to form a unique IP
      address. It takes the format of four sets of numbers, each of which ranges from 0 to 255 and represents an
      eight-digit binary number, separated by a period point.

      IP Address Classes
      Some IP addresses are reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). These are typically reserved
      for
      networks that carry a specific purpose on the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which
      is
      used to interconnect devices. Four of these IP address classes include:

      0.0.0.0: This IP address in IPv4 is also known as the default network. It is the non-routeable meta address
      that
      designates an invalid, non-applicable, or unknown network target.
      127.0.0.1: This IP address is known as the loopback address, which a computer uses to identify itself
      regardless
      of whether it has been assigned an IP address.
      169.254.0.1 to 169.254.254.254: A range of addresses that are automatically assigned if a computer is
      unsuccessful
      in an attempt to receive an address from the DHCP.
      255.255.255.255: An address dedicated to messages that need to be sent to every computer on a network or
      broadcasted across a network.
      Further reserved IP addresses are for what is known as subnet classes. Subnetworks are small computer networks
      that connect to a bigger network via a router. The subnet can be assigned its own IP address system, so that
      all
      devices connecting to it can communicate with each other without having to send data via the wider network.

      The router on a TCP/IP network can be configured to ensure it recognizes subnets, then route the traffic onto
      the
      appropriate network. IP addresses are reserved for the following subnets:

      Class A: IP addresses between 10.0.0.0 and 10.255.255.255
      Class B: IP addresses between 172.16.0.0 and 172.31.255.255
      Class C: IP addresses between 192.186.0.0 and 192.168.255.255
      Class D or multicast: IP addresses between 224.0.0.0 and 239.255.255.255
      Class E, which are reserved for experimental usage: IP addresses between 240.0.0.0 and 254.255.255.254
      IP addresses listed under Class A, Class B, and Class C are most commonly used in the creation of subnets.
      Addresses within the multicast or Class D have specific usage rules outlined in the Internet Engineering Task
      Force (IETF) guidelines, while the release of Class E addresses for public use was the cause of plenty of
      debate
      before the IPv6 standard was introduced.

      Internet Addresses and Subnets
      The IANA reserves specific IP address blocks for commercial organizations, government departments, and ISPs.
      When
      a user connects to the internet, their ISP assigns them an address from within one of the blocks assigned to
      it.
      If they only go online from one computer, then they can use the address assigned to it by their ISP.

      However, most homes now use routers that share a network connection with multiple devices. So if a router is
      used
      to share the connection, then the ISP assigns the IP address to the router, and then a subnet is created for
      all
      computers that connect to it.

      IP addresses that fall within a subnet have a network and a node. The subnet is identified by the network. The
      node, also known as the host, connects to the network and needs its own address. Computers separate the
      network
      and node via a subnet mask, which filters the appropriate IP address designation. When a large network is set
      up,
      the subnet mask that best fits the number of nodes or subnets required is determined.

      When it comes to IP addresses within a subnet, the first address is reserved for the subnet, and the final one
      indicates the broadcast address for the subnet’s systems.

      IPv4 vs IPv6
      IPv4 has not been able to cope with the massive explosion in the quantity and range of devices beyond simply
      mobile phones, desktop computers, and laptops. The original IP address format was not able to handle the
      number of
      IP addresses being created.

      To address this problem, IPv6 was introduced. This new standard operates a hexadecimal format that means
      billions
      of unique IP addresses can now be created. As a result, the IPv4 system that could support up to around 4.3
      billion unique numbers has been replaced by an alternative that, theoretically, offers unlimited IP addresses.

      That is because an IPv6 IP address consists of eight groups that contain four hexadecimal digits, which use 16
      distinct symbols of 0 to 9 followed by A to F to represent values of 10 to 15.

      How Do I Locate My IP Address?
      Windows computer users can look up their IP address by typing "cmd" into the search tab and hitting Enter,
      then
      typing "ipconfig" into the pop-up box. Mac computer users can find their IP address by heading into System
      Preferences and selecting Network.

      To look up an IP address on a mobile phone, users need to head into Settings, then open the Wi-Fi menu and
      their
      network menu. The IP address should be listed under the Advanced section, depending on the phone they use.

      IP address vs MAC address
      When you analyze an IP address vs. a MAC address, you can start with the similarities. For both of these IP
      address types, you are dealing with a unique identifier with an attachment to that device. The manufacturer of
      a
      network card or router is the provider of the MAC address, while the internet service provider (ISP) is the
      provider of the IP address.

      The main difference between the two is that the MAC address is the physical address of a device. If you have
      five
      laptops on your home Wi-Fi network, you can identify each of those five laptops on your network via their MAC
      address.

      The IP address works differently as it is the identifier of the connection of the network with that device.
      Other
      differences include:

      A MAC address is a 6-byte hexadecimal address while an IP address is a 4 or 16-byte address.
      A MAC address is in a data link layer, while an IP address is in a network layer.
      A third party will have a difficult time finding a MAC address, while it can easily find an IP address.
      MAC addresses are static, while IP addresses can change dynamically
      MAC addresses and IP addresses are necessary to get a network packet to a destination. However, no one can see
      your MAC address unless they are on your LAN
      What are security threats related to IP addresses?
      A variety of security threats are related to IP addresses. Cybercriminals can deceive devices to either reveal
      your IP address and pretend they are you or stalk it to track activity and take advantage. Online stalking and
      social engineering are the two leading security threats existing for IP addresses.

      Some of the other security threats to an IP address include:

      Allowing a cybercriminal to use your IP address to track your location
      Using your IP address to target your network and launch a DDoS attack
      Using your IP address to download illegal content
      5 ways to protect your IP address
      There are multiple ways to protect your IP address from cybercriminals. Some of these options include:

      Use a VPN
      Make use of a proxy server
      Have your ISP make use of dynamic IP addresses
      Employ a NAT firewall to hide your private IP address
      Resetting your modem may change your IP address

    <p>What is SMTP?
      SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. It is a communication protocol used for sending and receiving
      email
      messages over the Internet. Mail servers and other message transfer agents (MTAs) use SMTP to send, receive
      and
      relay mail messages.

      What does SMTP stand for?
      SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.

      What is SMTPS?
      SMTPS (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure) is a method for securing the SMTP using transport layer security.
      It
      is intended to provide authentication of the communication partners, data integrity and confidentiality. It
      uses
      SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to establish a secure
      connection, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the email transmission. The client and server speak
      normal SMTP at the application layer, and the connection is secured by SSL or TLS.

      What is an SMTP server?
      An SMTP server, also known as an outgoing mail server, is a computer or software that handles outgoing email
      messages. Generally, a mail server refers to a system that gathers, handles, and delivers email. An SMTP
      server
      refers specifically to the component of the mail server that uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to
      send
      outgoing mail. While the mail server handles both incoming and outgoing emails, the SMTP server is concerned
      solely with the task of sending and relaying outgoing emails to their appropriate destinations. It can also be
      referred as an outgoing email server.

      What is the SMTP server for Gmail?
      The SMTP server for Gmail is smtp.gmail.com. When configuring your email client or server to send emails using
      Gmail, you would typically use this SMTP server address along with your Gmail account credentials.

      How does SMTP work?
      In the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) model, the sender's email client or server acts as the SMTP
      client,
      and the sender’s email server acts as the SMTP server. This client initiates a connection to the server and
      transmits the email, complete with recipient details, subject, and body. The server processes this email and
      determines the suitable next server based on the recipient's address. This next server could either be another
      SMTP server in the transmission route or the final destination, i.e., the recipient's email server. Once the
      message arrives at the recipient's server, it's delivered to the recipient's inbox using a different protocol,
      such as POP or IMAP.</p>
